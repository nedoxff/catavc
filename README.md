# [catavc](https://nedoxff.github.io/projects/catavc)

catavc was an alternate client to [meow.camera](https://meow.camera/viewer) that supported browsers which didn't have HEVC (H.265) support. it transcoded HEVC video into AVC via [a stripped down version of ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/dumbmoron/ffwasm524).

this project has been archived in favor of meow.camera since it got updated to do similar stuff (transcoding on both client and server-side). it also looks really good, please check it out!

this code is here purely for archival purposes, and may be removed from the nedoxff.github.io website in a few weeks.
